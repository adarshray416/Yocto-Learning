Use previously implemented animal app's C++ source files with animal and dog classes but this time those files should be local.

Use helloworld app implemented as the first application

Use both apps copied into one "new" layer

Modify the animal app to output different strings according the parameter passed during the build time.
Ex
#IFDEF DEBUG_1
std::cout << "Dog is barking, Debug 1";
#ELIF DEBUG_2
std::cout << "Dog is barking, Debug 2";
#ELIF DEBUG_3
std::cout << "Dog is barking, Debug 3";
#ENDIF
